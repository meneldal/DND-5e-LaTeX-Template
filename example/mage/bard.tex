{Never Gonna Give You Up}
{10}
[Song]
{While the enemy's skills may fail, this spectral songster will never give them up, never let them down, never run around and desert them.\\
You can use this skill as an immediate interrupt whenever an enemy tries to use a skill. Roll STY vs the enemy's relevant stat. If you succeed, the enemy's skill fizzles and a spectral singer named Rick Ghastley is summoned, who serenades the enemy. The ghost sticks around for 1 round per STY rank preventing the enemy from using that same skill again.\\
This only works on specific skills. If you prevent the enemy from casting a spell, Rick Ghastley prevents them from casting that same spell again, but the enemy can cast other spells. If this skill prevents the enemy from making a weapon attack against their target, the enemy can attack different targets with the same weapon or attack the same target in a different way.\\
The form this skill takes is subject to GM Discretion. For example, when used to interrupt a fireball, the spell may simply fail to appear while Rick Ghastley appears instead. If used to prevent a weapon attack, the target may be moved just out of range while Rick Ghastley appears as a singing barrier to block attacks.\\
This skill cannot be used on the same enemy more than once per combat.
