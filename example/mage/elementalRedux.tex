{Elemental}
{MAG (Strength of Effects) / AGI (Casting Speed) / INT (Spell Failure)}
{Also called Thaumaturges in some circles, those who specialize in elemental magic are a force to be reckoned with. By drawing in magic from their surroundings, they are able to unleash tremendous power without draining their own magic.
This power comes at a price. Drawing in magic takes time, and if their spells are interrupted, the magic can very easily go wild.}
{The quintessential glass cannon, elemental mages provide massive firepower to any group that can keep them safe while they charge their spells. Depending on the elements they specialize in, they can also provide a wide array of utilitarian spells.}[ 
Elemental magic channels magic from your surroundings to create specific effects. Magic is molded into one of 10 natural elements or released as raw mana.
\subsubsection{Affinity:}
	You must possess an elemental affinity to cast spells of that element safely. You can purchase affinities for spells you’ve successfully cast a number of times equal to the spell’s rank. Spells you have affinity for are called favored spells. Casting a favored spell takes 2 actions instead of the normal charge time.
	XP costs for spell affinities are calculated like custom skills. See the Custom Skill Creation Guide for more details.
\subsubsection{Casting:}
	Like all charged spells, elemental spells have no MAG cost to cast them. Casting a spell takes a number of actions based on the complexity of the spell. These actions are spent drawing in mana from your surroundings, speaking incantations, and concentrating on the desired outcome. You cannot take other actions while casting. Spells activate the action after they are fully charged.
	If you are interrupted while casting, a Wild Magic effect occurs (For more details, see the Wild Magic table).
\subsubsection{Cast Times:}
	Elemental spells require a minimum of 2 actions to cast. One action to draw in mana and a second to activate the spell.
	A basic 2 action spell works as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Roll MAG (RD) + STR (SB) for melee spells or AGI (SB) for ranged spells vs. target's defense.
\item Can only affect a single target.
\item On a success, target takes wounds equal to your MAG rank.
\item On failure, target takes 1 wound.
\item Wounds are of whatever elemental affinity is being used.
	You can build more powerful spells by increasing the cast time with any of the following effects:
\item +1 Action to add a range of up to 5m per MAG rank. Using additional actions stacks the effect.
\item +1 Action to add an area of effect up to a radius of 3m per MAG rank. Using additional actions stacks the effect.
\item +1 Action to add up to 1 additional target per MAG rank. Using additional actions stacks the effect.
\item +1 Action to add a duration of up to 5 minutes per MAG rank. Using additional actions stacks the effect.
\item +1 Action to add an additional element to the spell. You must already have the proper affinity. Using additional actions stacks the effect.
\item +1 Action to add a special effect related to the element. Examples include paralysis (lightning), poison (wood), flight (air), etc.
\end{itemize}
	If you have an effect in mind and don't see it on this list, ask your GM. Elemental mages are encouraged to be creative.
\subsubsection{Charge Limits:}
	You can charge spells up for a number of actions equal to your MAG stat.
\subsubsection{Casting Above MAG:}
	You can attempt to cast spells above your MAG rank. However, charging spells for more actions than your MAG rank is difficult and dangerous.
	You must blackjack an INT check before you can cast. If you pass your INT check, but do not blackjack, the spell fizzles and nothing happens. If you fail this check, a Wild Magic effect occurs. Charging requires double the number of actions.
\subsubsection{Casting Without an Affinity:}
	If you have at least one elemental skill, you can attempt to cast spells of an element you don't have an affinity for. However, doing so is incredibly difficult.
	You must make a successful INT check to begin casting. Failure to pass this check results in a wild magic effect. Charging requires double the number of actions.
